This is a bit of fun with Terraform and Python to create a random animal with two random adjectives or adverbs. After the file is created it is then read and emailed to a Gmail account. Configure a .env file and set the following environment variables that are used for email credentials:

FROM_EMAIL="name of the user email you are sending from."

TO_EMAIL="name of the user email you are sending to."

PASSWORD="your FROM_EMAIL user's password for the email account."
